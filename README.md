## RPH-HAC-Prediction
Predicting Hospital Acquired Complications (HACs) in collaboration with Royal Perth Hospital.

### Overview
This project aims to leverage machine learning and data analytics to predict Hospital Acquired Complications (HACs) using historical patient data from Royal Perth Hospital. Our goal is to enhance patient care by providing healthcare professionals with tools to anticipate and mitigate potential complications.

### Background
Hospital Acquired Complications (HACs) pose significant risks to patient health and recovery. By using data-driven approaches, this project aims to identify potential risks early on, enabling timely intervention and improving overall patient outcomes.

### Usage
Detailed Jupyter Notebooks are provided for data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. Navigate through the notebooks to understand the entire workflow.
